<a>All UVA faculty are eligible to request an allocation for their group. Postdocs and staff are encouraged to use the allocation provided by a faculty sponsor. Postdocs and satff may request their own allocation pending departmental or RC approval. UVA graduate and undergraduate students are not permitted to request allocationsâ€”this must be done by their faculty advisor[s]. Researchers with sponsored accounts are also prohibited from requesting allocations, but they may use Rivanna as members of a Grouper account controlled by an eligible PI.</a>
