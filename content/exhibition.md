## Dear Researcher,
UVA Research Computing, in partnership with the Data Analytics Center 
(DAC), is proud to announce the <strong>first annual UVA Computational 
Research Exhibition</strong> on Tuesday, April 23, 2024 from 11:30 a.m. â€“ 4:00 
p.m. in the Newcomb Hall Ballroom. This exhibition includes a judged poster 
competition with travel awards presented to the finalists.
<br>  
All researchers using Research Computing resources are encouraged to 
submit posters. Research Computing resources include systems, software, 
and support such as how you use the Rivanna, Ivy, or other Research 
Computing resources in your research.
<br><br>
To be eligible for a prize, the lead author must be someone other than a 
faculty member/PI.
<br><br>
Three grand prize winners will be chosen, and they will receive travel awards
that can be used for professional travel, including conferences, meetings of 
professional associations, or other travel related to your research.
<ul>
    <li>First Place: $3,000 travel voucher
