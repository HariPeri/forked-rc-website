{{< alert-green >}}The UVA HPC systems, Afton/Rivanna, will experience a temporary shutdown of some compute nodes on  <strong>Saturday, October 25, 2025</strong> beginning at 7 am.{{< /alert-green >}}

ITS will perform scheduled maintenance and testing of the [Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS)](https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=services_status_info) at the University Data Center on Saturday, Oct. 25, 2025, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. This work will affect the electrical power to several compute nodes located in generator-only racks, including:  

- **25 nodes in the gpu partition** 
- **70 nodes in the standard partition** 
- **26 nodes in the interactive partition** 
- **Most of the Biocomplexity Institute dedicated nodes** 

To protect this hardware from potential power fluctuations, Research Computing will proactively shut down the affected nodes for the duration of the maintenance. All nodes are expected to be **back in service by 7 p.m. the same day**. 

Job submissions will be unaffected. However, jobs that involve the affected nodes may experience longer queue times. 


### What to Expect During Partial Shutdown  

**Access:**
 
No impact on the ability to login or use the HPC systems. 

**Jobs:**
 
Due to the temporary unavailability of some compute nodes, your jobs may experience longer queue times. However, job submission to these nodes will remain unaffected. 

**Storage:**
 
Our storage systems remain accessible, and no interruptions are expected. 

Any updates or changes will be posted on the [RC website](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/). If you have any questions about this partial shutdown, please [contact our user services team](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/support/).
