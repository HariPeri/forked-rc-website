{{< alert-green >}}The HPC system in the standard security zone, including <i>Rivanna</i>, will be down on <strong>Tuesday, July 2, 2024</strong> beginning at 6 a.m. During the downtime RC engineers will implement final configuration changes in preparation of the <b>full production release of the new <i>Afton HPC system</i></b>.{{< /alert-green >}}

You may continue to submit jobs until the maintenance period begins, but if the system determines your job will not have time to finish, it will not start until the HPC systems are returned to service.

The *Rivanna* and *Afton* production systems are expected to return to service by **Wednesday, July 3 at 6 a.m.**

{{% accordion-item title="May 30, 2024 - Afton is available in pre-release configuration" id="comm-3" %}}

**Effective May 30**, the new Afton HPC hardware is now available in a pre-release configuration as part of the HPC environment. During this pre-release phase the number of available Afton nodes may fluctuate as the RC team completes final configurations. The full production release of the Afton cluster with stable service of all 300 nodes is planned for **Tuesday, July 2**. [Learn more](/2024/05/rivanna-maintenance-may-28-2024/).

{{% accordion-item title="May 20, 2024 - Reminder: Rivanna maintenance and Afton pre-release" id="comm-1" %}}

Dear Rivanna user: 
  

A friendly reminder that Rivanna and Research Project storage will be down for maintenance from Tuesday, May 28 at 6 a.m. through Thursday, May 30 6 a.m..  

  
**How to prepare and what to expect during the maintenance?** 
You may continue to submit jobs to Rivanna until the maintenance period begins, but if the system determines your job will not have time to finish, it will not start until Rivanna is returned to service. All Rivanna compute nodes and login nodes will be offline, including the Open OnDemand and FastX portals. Research Project storage will be unavailable. The UVA Standard Security Storage data transfer node (DTN) and Research Standard storage remain online throughout the maintenance period.  
  
**Pre-release of the new Afton cluster after the maintenance** 
All systems are expected to return to service by 6 a.m. on Thursday, May 30. The new Afton HPC hardware will become available in a pre-release configuration at that time, with the addition of 300 new compute nodes, 96 cores each, based on the AMD EPYC 9454 architecture. The new Afton hardware will provide additional capacity for serial, parallel and GPU computing side-by-side with the existing Rivanna system. During this pre-release phase the number of available Afton nodes may fluctuate as the RC team completes final configurations. The full production release of the Afton cluster with stable service of all 300 nodes is planned for Tuesday, July 2. 
 
A detailed description of the maintenance plan and instructions for using the new Afton resources is available on the RC website.   
 
If you have any questions about the Rivanna maintenance or Afton pre-release, you may contact our user services team. 
  
At your service, RC staff
