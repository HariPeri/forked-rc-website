Glaucoma is a chronic eye disease that can lead to irreversible vision loss if not properly managed. Effectively stratifying patient risk is a major clinical challenge, as clinicians need tools to identify patients at high risk of progression from sparse and irregularly-sampled electronic health records. Traditional forecasting methods struggle with the irregular time-series data typical of EHRs, where features vary with visits and occur at different intervals. Towards developing these critical risk identification tools, DAC consultants collaborated with Dr. Heman Shakeriâ€™s lab from the School of Data Science as well as with advice from clinicians to develop a novel deep kernel learning architecture that leverages a Gaussian Process backend with a transformer-based feature extractor to model glaucoma patient trajectories from multimodal EHR data.
Using pre-trained clincal-BERT embeddings and multi-modal features (NLP, tabular, etc) to improve predictive calibration, this collaboration led to the following key outcomes:
* Development of a model that successfully identified three clinically distinct patient subgroups by decoupling current disease severity from future progression risk
* Discovery that patients with moderate vision but high trajectory variance represent a high-risk group requiring intensive monitoring, despite having better average visual acuity than chronically poor but stable patients
* Achievement of high accuracy within 0.1 logMAR with calibrated uncertainty estimates that correctly identify patients with volatile disease courses
* Creation of deep kernel learning models that either matched or outperformed traditional recurrent neural network and transformer-based forecasting methods
This collaboration demonstrates the model's ability to identify progression risk rather than just current disease state, offering a powerful tool for clinical decision support that enables targeted interventions for high-risk individuals and improved management of glaucoma care.
