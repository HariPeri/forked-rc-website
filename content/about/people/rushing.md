Dr. Bruce Rushing is a Research Scientist within the Data Analytics Center (DAC). The DAC provides machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) analytics to UVA researchers as a core part of its mission. Dr. Rushing has expertise in ML and AI, with an emphasis on generative probabilistic modeling, deep learning with neural networks, and large language models (LLMs). His previous work at the DAC includes probabilistic models for glaucoma patient trajectories, next-image segmentation and generation with time-series MRI data, and LLM fine-tuning for modeling semantic shifts in scientific descriptions of American wildlife. Previously, he conducted foundational research on ML, statistics, LLMs, and causal discovery as a Postdoc at Purdue University's Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence lab. He is a trained computational philosopher and statistician, and he has a PhD in Philosophy and MA in Mathematical Behavioral Sciences from the University of California, Irvine, where his dissertation focused on the decision-theoretic foundations for Bayesian and causal inference. His research interests focus on the foundations of statistics and causal modeling and scientific theorizing that emphasize building algorithms for reliable induction.
