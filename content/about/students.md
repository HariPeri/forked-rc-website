<p class="lead" >
The Research Computing Student Worker Program is dedicated to supporting RC staff and advancing computational research at UVA. Through this program, student workers will undertake short-term projects, relieving RC staff of certain responsibilities and allowing them to devote more time to scaling support for complex, research-domain endeavors. This initiative not only benefits RC staff but also provides students with valuable exposure to high-performance computing (HPC) and scientific computing early in their academic journey.
